            It's a bit weird in the beginning, I know. But this way you never have to leave the home row,
            and once you get used to it, you will wonder how you ever could have survived without it

            But.. those poor smileys! How about we bring them back again?

            Undo: Control+Z
            Redo: Control+Shift+Z

            ### Insert mode ###
            ###################


            To <I>nsert some text, press I

            How about you insert some text in the blanks?

            First enter Insert mode, and press backspace to delete the blank, and start typing!

            When you're done, hit Escape, and you will go back to normal mode

            wow, this tutorial is _! It's making me feel all kinds of stuff, like _ and _. I should _ the author and _ him.

            ### delete 1 character ###
            ##########################


            "Oh man. Oh geez. Mr. Author, hitting "I" and Backspace just to delete one character seems really inefficient"

            An astute observation my dear reader! That is exactly why you can press "x" in normal mode instead.

            How about ?you ^ use it to clean up+ this sentence?@

            ### Jump along indentation ###
            ##############################

            As you know, j and k move you up and down.

            But sometimes you want to jump a bit further.

            J and K will move you to the next block of text that has the same indentation.

            Give it a try!


            if (happy && youKnowIt) {
                HandClapperRequest request = HandClapperManager.Instance.BuildHandClapperRequest();
                try {
                    r.requestHandClap();
                    r.clap();
                } catch (ClapsNotAllowedAtWorkException e) {
                    CryRequest cr = TearCanal.BuildCryRequest();
                    cr.forceCry();
                }

                AggressiveBowelMovementHandler.run();
            }


            Sweet, huh? I expect you to use it to jump between sections in the rest of this tutorial! Or I'll find you and cut you








            #################################
            ### Jump to begin/end of line ###
            #################################

            In the same vein, H and L will take you to the beginning and end of the current line.
            Try it out!


            <jump here!>                                                                                         <and here!>











            ######################
            ### Visual jumping ###
            ######################

            Let's say you have a jumble of text like below, and you want to jump to the '!' in the middle.

            "Oh geez, That's a lot of "hjkl":ses!", you might say. Do not fear, for "<F>ind character" is here!

            Press f, and then the character you want to jump to (in this case '!'), and press the character that shows up in its place.

            It's probably easier to understand if you just try it.

            ### The menu ###
            ################

            Press ':' to enter THE MENU <a cascade of obnoxious airhorns>.
            You can do everything from here. But probably the most important thing you should never touch which is quit. Because why would you want that
            Try typing some stuff like save, close, "set indent" etc.
            It has fuzzy autocomplete, so you should be decently able to find what you're looking for.
            Extra points if you find the hidden cake.

            Oh, and Enter to choose the current selection, and Escape to exit.

            ### Select area ###
            ###################

            Press S to start Selection.
            A marker will be placed there to indicate where you started the selection.
            To Delete the selection, press D.
            Well learn more things you can do with selection further on
