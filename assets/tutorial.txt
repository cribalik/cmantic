            Before we start, please press '+' and '-' to make the font bigger or smaller.

            Happy you are here! Let's get started, shall we?







            You can use hjkl to move around.

            Try to follow this line: ___________________

                                                                          /                            |                                  
                                                                          |                            |                                  
                                                                          \____________________________/                                  
                                                                                                                                        

            It's a bit weird in the beginning, I know. But this way you never have to leave the home row,
            and once you get used to it, you will wonder how you ever could have survived without it

            ### Line delete ###
            ###################

            To <D>elete a line, press Shift+D

            Try it out on these suckers!

            :(
                        :'(
                                  :)
                 D:
                     O_O








            #################
            ### Undo/Redo ###
            #################


            But.. those poor smileys! How about we bring them back again?

            Undo: Control+Z
            Redo: Control+Shift+Z








            ###################
            ### Insert mode ###
            ###################


            To <I>nsert some text, press I. This will put you in "Insert Mode", where you can type away freely.

            The normal mode is called.. Normal Mode. You can see the current mode you're in in the status bar at the bottom.

            Now, how about you insert some text in the blanks?

            First enter Insert mode, and press backspace to delete the blank, and start typing!

            When you're done, hit Escape, and you will go back to normal mode





            wow, this tutorial is _! It's making me feel all kinds of stuff, like _ and _. I should _ the author and _ him.

            ### delete 1 character ###
            ##########################


            "Oh man. Oh geez. Mr. Author, hitting "I" and Backspace just to delete one character seems really inefficient"

            An astute observation my dear reader! That is exactly why you can press "x" in normal mode instead.

            How about ?you ^ use it to clean up+ this sentence?@











            ##############################
            ### Jump along indentation ###
            ##############################

            As you know, J and K move you up and down.

            But sometimes you want to jump a bit further.

            Shift+J and Shift+K will move you to the next block of text that has the same indentation.

            Give it a try!


            if (happy && youKnowIt) {
                HandClapperRequest request = HandClapperManager.Instance.BuildHandClapperRequest();
                try {
                    r.requestHandClap();
                    r.clap();
                } catch (ClapsNotAllowedException e) {
                    CryRequest cr = TearCanal.BuildCryRequest();
                    cr.forceCry();
                }

                AggressiveBowelMovementHandler.run();
            }


            Sweet, huh? I expect you to use it to jump between sections in the rest of this tutorial! Or I'll find you and cut you








            #################################
            ### Jump to begin/end of line ###
            #################################

            In the same vein, H and L will take you to the beginning and end of the current line.
            Try it out!


            <jump here!>                                                                                         <and here!>











            ######################
            ### Visual jumping ###
            ######################

            Let's say you have a jumble of text like below, and you want to jump to the '!' in the middle.

            "Oh geez, That's a lot of "hjkl":ses!", you might say. Do not fear, for "<F>ind character" is here!

            Press F, and then the character you want to jump to (in this case '!'), and press the character that shows up in its place.

            It's probably easier to understand if you just try it.

            ################
            ### The menu ###
            ################

            Press ':' to enter.. !!THE MENU!! <queue cascade of obnoxious airhorns>.
            You can do everything from here. But probably the most important thing you should never touch is quit. Because why would you want that.
            Try typing some stuff like save, close, "set indent" etc.
            It has fuzzy autocomplete, so you should be decently able to find what you're looking for.
            Extra points if you find the hidden cake.

            Oh, and Enter to choose the current selection, and Escape to exit.












            ###################
            ### Select area ###
            ###################

            Press S to start Selection.
            A marker will be placed there to indicate where you started the selection.
            To Delete the selection, press D.
            We'll learn more things you can do with selection further on


            ________________ohgodpleasedeleteme______________












            ######################
            ### Copy and paste ###
            ######################

            Using C and P, you can Copy and Paste.
            C by itself doesn't know how much to copy, so you can use Select to select an area, and then press C to Copy it.
            Then press P to Paste it somewhere.
            If you make a new Selection and then Paste, the Pasted text will replace the Selection.

            How about you replace all occurances of <one direction> with <cmantic> on the next line using Copy, Paste, and Select?



            Omg <one direction> is the best, how could I have missed that <one direction> was a thing for so long.
            From now on, I am going to talk about nothing else but <one direction> with all my friends.













            ################
            ### Movement ###
            ################


            W:    move forward by Word
            B:    move Back by word
            {, }: move to previous/next brace
            [, ]: move to previous/next bracket
            (, ): move to previous/next paren








            ##############################
            ### Movement + Action = <3 ###
            ##############################

            As we said above, Copy doesn't know by itself how much to copy.
            You can tell it with a Selection, but thats a bit clunky.
            Instead, we can combine Copy with a movement! If you do a movement after pressing C,
            instead of actually moving you will Copy the area you would've covered with the movement.
            Try Copying the Word below. Go to the beginning of it and press C followed by W. You will have copied the whole word.

            CopyThisWord.

            A command that can be combined with a movement is called an action. We'll look at a few other actions in the following sections







            #####################
            ### Delete Action ###
            #####################

            An action that works with movements is the Delete action. Press D, followed by a movement, and it will delete the area that would've been covered by the movement.
            Try it on this function. Stand by the function name, and press 'D' followed by '}', and instead of moving to the matching '}', you delete that range instead.

            def this_is_a_function() {
                beep();
                beep();
                boop();
            }








            ######################
            ### Replace Action ###
            ######################

            Yet another action is the Replace action. It performs first a Delete and then a Paste.
            Try Copying the following line using Shift+H, Copy (C), and Shift+L, and replace the second line with a well-placed Replace Shift+L.

            Copy this entire line by standing to the left and doing C Shift+L
            And then replace this entire line by standing to the left and doing R Shift+L












            ####################
            ### Action Areas ###
            ####################


            A movement isn't the only way to apply an action.
            You can for example apply an action to an entire string by following the action with a "

            Try out the "Delete" action on "the strings in" this "crafty" but "silly line"

            The available areas are:

            ": entire string
            p: current comma-separated block of code (Parameter)
            {, }, [, ], (, ): The same as the corresponding movement, but including the final character
